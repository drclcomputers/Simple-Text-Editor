# Simple-Text-Editor
A very basic text editor made in python

This is a file created with this simple text editor.
It can read any format and doesn't require a file extension.
When started, you are presented with 3 options:
1. Write - Creates a new file
2. Open - Opens a file
3. Exit - Closes the editor
Don't forget to add the address if you want to save the file in a different location, other than the folder where the program is located!

To exit WRITE mode type 'exit' on a new line without the quotation marks. This word won't be included in the actual file.
