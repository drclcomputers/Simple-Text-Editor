# Simple-Text-Editor
A very basic text editor written originally in Python and re-written in C++.

This is a file created with this simple text editor.
It can read any format and doesn't require a file extension.
When started, you are presented with 3 options:
1. Write - Creates a new file
2. Open - Opens a file
3. Exit - Closes the editor
Don't forget to add the address if you want to save the file in a different location, other than the folder where the program is located!

To exit WRITE mode type 'exit' on a new line without the quotation marks. This word won't be included in the actual file.

Requires Windows 95 or newer.
Note: To run in Windows 95 and maybe 98 (I don't have a Win 98 VM at the moment) you need to download msvcrt.dll file, too. Otherwise it won't start.

I'm really impresed by this. I wrote this program in Windows 10 and it works from the old Windows 95 all the way up to Windows 11 without needing to be rewritten or recompiled.
